sumo-nodejs
===========

This is a helper class for calling the [Sumotext Api](http://sumotext.github.io) from a nodejs platform.

##Quick Start
```
mkdir project-dir
cd project-dir
npm install sumo-nodejs
```
>  Note: Your IP address must be registered with Sumotext in order to make API calls. If it isn't, you will receive `ERROR:NOTIP` as a response to the endpoints.
